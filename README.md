# Game Pad
- Our mission for this project was to take our new-found knowledge and 
  try to build our own games from scratch.
- We used Angular as our front-end framework and Spring as our back-end framework.
- We set out with a simple goal of testing our skills and understanding of the 
  frameworks we used to build this project.
- We started with a simple game that we called `Pong` and we built it entirely using Typescript.
- Use `ng serve` to run the application locally on a dev server. 


- We used the following libraries:
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/)
  - [Spring](https://spring.io/)
  - [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


## User Stories
- User has access to 3 different games on the landing page:
  - `Pong`
  - `Mega-man prototype`
  - `Minesweeper`


- User can navigate to the game page by clicking on the buttons with the desired game name.
- This will change the contents of the canvas as well as reset the others games.


## Pong Info:
- The game is a single player game where the user can move the paddle left
  and right using the mouse while hovering over the canvas.
- The game is played by using the paddle to stop the ball from reaching 
  the bottom of the screen.
- If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen, the ball will reset to the middle of the screen
  and continue to move about the canvas, while bouncing off the other bounding walls.




## Mega-man Prototype Info:
- User can move the character left and right using the `A` and `D` keys.
- If the character doesn't move, it will trigger an idle animation where he blinks every few seconds.
- User can jump by pressing the `Spacebar` and the character will jump higher the longer it is pressed.


## Minesweeper Info:
