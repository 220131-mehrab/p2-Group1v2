# Game Pad
- Our mission for this project was to take our new-found knowledge and 
  try to build our own games from scratch.
- We used Angular as our front-end framework and Spring as our back-end framework.
- We set out with a simple game that we called `Pong` and we built it using Typescript.

- We used the following libraries:
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/)
  - [Spring](https://spring.io/)
  - [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  

## User Stories
- User has access to 3 different games on the landing page:
  - `Pong`
  - `Mega-man prototype`
  - `Minesweeper`


- User can navigate to the game page by clicking on the buttons with desired game name.
- This will change the contents of the canvas as well as reset the others games.


## Pong Info:
- The game is a single player game where the user can move the paddle left
  and right using the mouse while hovering over the canvas.
- The game is played by using the paddle to stop the ball from reaching 
  the bottom of the screen.
- If the ball reaches the bottom of the screen, the ball will reset to the middle of the screen
  and continue to move about the canvas.



## Mega-man Prototype Info:
- User can move the character left and right using the `A` and `D` keys.
- If the character doesn't move, it will trigger an idle animation where he blinks every few seconds.
- User can jump by pressing the `Spacebar` and the character will jump higher the longer it is pressed.


## Minesweeper Info:
